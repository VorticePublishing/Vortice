Over the years dedicated to editorial projects we have built a team of versatile, creative and talented individuals in the fields of literary edition, editorial design, publishing, bookbinding and web development. We are comited to explore the possibilities of the writen word in the digital world and the preservation, curation and broad acesibility of great works of literature over the internet.
